Credit Card Fraud Detection using Machine Learning and Python 💳🤖
This model may be useful to banks to fight theft/fraud going on, on their user's account. 🏦🔒

Here we got 95% accuracy on Training data and 92% on Testing data which is awesome. 🎯
Here we are going to see how we can build a Machine Learning model to differentiate real and fraudulent transactions. 💡

Time is in seconds. ⏱️
Here in Class 0 represents legit transaction and 1 represents fraudulent transaction. ⚖️

Here our data is processed using a principal component analysis function because they cannot give us the details about the transaction. 🔍It may contain a user's personal information that's why we have features in those kinds of numbers which doesn't make any sense for us.

Those columns in our dataset are really important for our prediction. 📊
